Good to see most of you found the course briefing videos useful. Previously, course admin info used to be
covered during weekly briefings, but since last sem we started extracting them out as a separate
category of videos called 'course briefing' videos.

Glad to see most found weekly briefings to be useful.

A general note: Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, 
 our weekly briefings serve as a _complementary_ 'top up', covering additional examples,
 motivations behind the topics, commentary on how to shape your attitudes related to the subject,
 anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip weekly briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-briefing quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 **:fas-exclamation: Caveat: Totally ignoring weekly briefings will disqualify you from future CS2103/T 
 tutor positions**
 though, as we do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course.

The feedback for the course website is quite positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, we thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**Common complaint: too much to read!** It is true that our course website has a LOT more text content
 than one would expect. Some of it was added because at some point a student needed that (e.g., a student
 asks for some information that we realize is not present in the website -- so we add it).
 We do try to arrange the content in a way that is easier to navigate/consume, but it is hard, and I'm
 sure the current format and the level of details do not fit some of you.<br>
 **We also realize some are less inclined to absorb information via the text medium** (preferring other mediums
 such as demos, videos). We try to provide alternative formats as well -- we'll try to do more. 
 Note that the text format also has the advantage that it is the format you'll be referring to
 during the exam.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, if you are someone who normally prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part
 in tutorial discussions, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. 
 We hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure 
  (like many other things in this course)
  aims to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We had to move to F2F mode**, to comply with NUS
    policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), we expect physically
    meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
    We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
    both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
  * **Having two tutorials in the same venue is not ideal**, but we have no choice due to lack of enough
    small venues. So, it is a compromise we've made to keep tutor-to-student ratio low while making do with the
    current venues we have. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    Pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * **Less is more, hopefully**: So, while our tutorials only discuss a small number of relatively simpler questions,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ 
    has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class,
    although the learning gain for stronger students may be less than usual==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, we hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The pace seems to be an issue for some of you, although it seems to be manageable for most.<br>
**We need to go through topics faster than other courses** because you need to have some time left
 _after_ covering a topic to apply that knowledge into the project. 
 So, we need to finish covering topics about 2 weeks before the tP
 finishes, which means ==compressing 13-weeks worth of topics into about 10 weeks==. 
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

fewer students chose `*.5` options. So, given below is the view if we merge `n` and `n.5` bars.

Either way, it is interesting to see peaks around 4, 6, and 8, showing a big variation of how students
perceive the workload of this course.

**Why some students feel the workload as MUCH higher compared to others?** 
Here's a recap the possible reasons I mentioned during the Week 2 briefing:

1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are doing more work than others.**<br>
   Response: If this is because you are doing the course more sincerely (e.g., not skipping even optional
   topics/tasks); if so, it will pay off (i.e., you'll learn more) but you still might want to re-calibrate the time
   you spend on this course if you don't have enough time for other courses.<br>
   If this is because you are unaware of ways to reduce the workload (e.g., omitting optionla topics),
   refer to the recommendations given further below.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You need more time than others to complete course tasks**
   because you are an inexperienced coder.<br>
   Response: The good news is, you are getting more value from this course than others (your skills will
   improve a lot more from the course compared to others). But it is unavoidable that there is a price to pay
   (i.e., the extra time you spend on the course). If this is affecting your other courses, you might want to
   to cut down the work you do in the course, with the understanding that your skill improvement will be less too.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are taking short-cuts** (e.g., not doing weekly topics before you attempt weekly
   project tasks) to save time, but end up spending even more time as you lack the knowledge needed
   to do the task. For example, we noticed some who didn't do the JavaFX tutorial first ran into problems
   when doing iP Level-10, and wasted a lot of time troubleshooting them.<br>
   Response: This is concerning, and ill-advised (it results in a lose-lose outcome -- less learning, more time wasted).
   Instead, to reduce the time spent on this course without loosing too much value, follow our instructions/schedule
   closely, but omit optional topics/tasks and stop when you have reached the minimum requirement.


**We know the workload concern is real**, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. This course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice, which makes the workload feel heavy, especially if you are a beginner coder.<br>
  On our side, ==we have lowered the bar for the tP implementation component by half==
  last semester, and we have further cut down the tP documentation requirement this semester. 
  Hopefully, it'll make the workload of the second half lighter than in previous rounds.

**Some recommendations for you:**
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis.
    Aim to do less but do it really well.<br>
    ==Plan to add/update tP features in small steps== (each step leading to a usable and slightly better version
    of the feature), so that you can stop any time the workload seems to be exceeding what you are prepared for.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.

<markdown>really appreciate how this course focuses less on the correctness of answers as it lessens the stress of learning all the content. also appreciate how the course gives leeway for students to manage their own workload (non-strict deadlines, extra time to recover if we fall behind). also can evidently tell how passionate the prof is in teaching, thank you prof :)</markdown>

<markdown>Suggestion: Course should aim for either making the chatbot in CLI or GUI format because transitioning from CLI to GUI seems to be work overload.

Feedback: Really good module as it does not force you to do optional things, its just our wish to do it or not. The more we do the better knowledge we gain! Instructions are well laid for the new things we learn in this module.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad you liked the flexibility of the course.

It is true that evolving from CLI to GUI can appear a lot of work, which would be the case for most students. But the more important questions is, now that you've gone through it, if you were to do it again, would you design the CLI version differently so that adding a GUI is easier? The answer should be 'yes' -- the CLI version _can_ be written in a way that it is easy to swap out the CLI with GUI, or add the GUI while keeping the CLI as well. In software projects, it is always possible to have to implement features that were not aniticipated at the start, and the effort required to implement such features depends on the quality of the design. Not to worry if this doesn't sound convincing. We'll be covering more design-related topics in the coming weeks.

<markdown>The topic videos help in giving an overview of the content at a high level manner (or rather because I prefer video to reading text). The weekly briefing is interesting because it recaps the concepts with analogies and bring in additional insights. The analogies are helpful.

It is true that the workload for the course is rather high, but, I think it is part and parcel of learning. I don't see how it can be mitigated / have the workload decreased except requiring us to spend the time understanding the content and trying out the tools and code.

The workload might be a little much, but I guess it is also understandable given what this course is trying to achieve in terms of what to impart students with, which I really appreciate. I'm honestly really glad with the structure and admin side of this course (e.g some hard and some soft deadlines esp for IP) because it gives me the flexibility to catch up.

So, we try to make the project as small as possible, and deadlines as flexible as possible, so that you can have some windows of time away from this course when  necessary (e.g., near a mid-term exam of another course).

That plus the iP tasks have proven to be quite heavy for me. Coming into weeks 4, I feel that the amount of iP tasks have lighten by a significant amount which I think is good since more time is freed up for my other modules.

However, this does not mean I find the module dreadful. I can't deny it feels very tiring to do all the required tasks every week but I am glad that I am learning something each week. The concept of just having to hit the minimal level to get the marks also help to reduce the workload (though there are times I want to do more but lack the time to do so).

The thing I liked the most so far is the support that the teaching team has provided. This comes in the form of responding to forum questions and checking up with the students through emails based on the pre-course survey. In any modules, having a supportive teaching team like this is something I value a lot, not only does it encourage me to approach others more but it also allow me to place more focus on learning rather than grades. This is something that I think has been done well and I hope this will continue in the future as well.</markdown>

<markdown>Overall, i think the set-up of the module in terms of content, pedagogy, assessment weightage, methods are all good. However, there is a lack of concrete, specific feedbacks. I understand that alot of things in SWE are not black and white and is up to public consensus as well as following rules like coding standard. I also understand the part about learning through practice. However, it is very hard to improve without knowing what we did well or even better what we did wrong. To better illustrate using an example, for example git-standard, all we get is a green/red tag. Despite maintaining a consistent format (personal opinion of course) the tag some times is green sometimes is red. Which means  am left to guess which I dont think this is a good way to teach? Even if somehow the reason is for asssessment integrity, we should figure out ourselves, this contradicts the pass-fail aspect of iP and it being a way to improve ourselves before tP. I am sure we all can agree it is better to learn from mistakes than correct answers. Providing a coding standrad, quality and whatsoever is learning from correct answer. I do not know what i did wrong when something goes wrong and is left to guess. I think it is not difficult to add in the part where is violates the checking script as a log to feedback to us so we know what is done wrong/can be improved. Maybe the current way to force us to be more attentive to details as real world does not have answers or feedback (though not true as code review will tell us specifically what to do better). I think this current format can be maintained for example the first 4 weeks then for week 5, 6 concrete feedback can be released whenever things like, using the same example, git-standard violation occurs so that we can learn in time to not make the same mistake for tP otherwise, How am i different at week 1 and week 13 beside a few more educated guesses</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Thanks for the detailed and balanced feedback. You make a valid point. Learning by guessing is not a good way to learn. 



Some comments on the example of the GitStandard: Compared to many other SE aspects, the Git standard is concrete and objective. There are only a handful of rules, as given in https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html : start with a capital letter, use imperative mood, not longer than 72 chars, no fullstop. So, it should not be hard to figure out which of these rules is violated in the last five commits, when the tag truns red. More details of how we appraoch this Git Standard learning outcome (and why we do it that way) is among the general responses at the end of this page.

Looking beyond the example of the Git Standard (which is relatively more objective), many other SE aspects such as code readability (beyond concrete rules in the git/coding standard) are subjective, and the point you raised in general applies even more to such aspects. We wish we can give more specific feedback on such aspects but there are challenges arising from manpower limitations and the need for fairness/uniformity, quality (wrong feedback is worse than no feedback) etc. Still, it is an aspect we want to do better in future. 

In general, if you can't figure out why an item is red, just ask. In fact few other students asked in the forum why their GitStandard item is red and figured out the specifc reason with the help of others, earning forum participation credit in the process as well.

<markdown>instead of having to ask people to form teams. We get groups where there are already preexisting cliques.

 

What's the point of additional pointless stress like this? It doesn't aid in any meaningful or fun learning, they are already going to face this when they go to work.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>I'm not sure if you are asking us to allow or disallow students forming their own teams.

Both extremes have pros and cons so we try to take a middle ground where you _can_ form teams with others but within some constraints, so that in most cases you get to work with some people you know but also with some people you didn't know -- this is usually how it works in real SE projects too, in that a team usually has at least some colleagues (not necessarily 'friends') that you know from earlier but it can also have members you haven't come into contact before.</markdown>

<markdown>1. Navigating the course website does feel rather confusing and daunting, but only if I am not simply following the tasks week to week.

2. I think the less important information could benefit from having just 1 component, rather than 3 separate components. Or maybe include why there are 3 separate modals for it.

3. I definitely think that some of W3's tasks should be placed with W4 as A-MoreOOP takes a large chunk of time to accomplish as I would imagine many would need to refractor a large amount of their code. In comparison, the workload for W4 is a lot lighter.

4. Other than that, I am extremely grateful that the teaching team is putting in so much effort into running the module. Thank you so much!</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>1. You  are right about the website navigation being easier if you stick to the typical/standard schedule of tasks.

2. There are three alternative ways of showing less important info. The one that fits the surrounding context best wil be used.

3. True. Some of [my general responses](#general) are related to your comments.

4. You are welcome :-)

<markdown>There is way too much to read for the weekly topics. It usually takes me about 4-5h just to read them.

The weekly task sometimes take too long to do. For example,  just the week 3 task took me around 15h to do, and this excludes reading the weekly topics, watching the weekly lecture, and doing the weekly quiz. So if you add them all up, the workload for one week exceeds 20h which is more than double of the average workload of a 4mc module.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **iP workload is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
  Setting a slightly higher bar around that period can cause some students to fall behind a bit,
  which hopefully pushes them to work harder to catch up while there is still enough time to catch up
  i.e., it is better to fall behind early rather than later.<br>
  Finally, unexpected spikes in workload is not uncommon in SE projects. It is good to practice how to 
  deal with them.
* **Can give more feedback on if what we are doing is correct/wrong?**: Indeed, lack of such instructor feedback
  can make the learning 'less efficient' (i.e., it takes longer).
  As you can imagine, it is challenging to provide frequent high-quality
   instructor feedback for a class of this size, teaching a subjective domain such as SE.<br>
   As the same time, giving less of such feedback goes well with ==our aim to develop your
   <tooltip content="i.e., the ability to make decisions about the quality of one's own work
   and that of others">_evaluative judgement_ skills</tooltip>==, as this is a value skills for software engineers,
   especially in an era of AI-assisted coding.<br>
   We hope that dashboards, automated feedbacks, forum discussions, iterative approach etc. we have provided
   will further help you deal with lack of such feedback directly from instructors.<br>
   To give a concrete example, here's how we apply this to one concrete learning outcome:
   * #g#**Learning Outcome (LO)**##: _can follow the Git convention for commit messages_<br> 
     #g#**Target LO Level**##: _follows the Git convention as a habit, and is able to self-evaluate/monitor_
   * #g#**Assessment**## (i.e., how to determine if the LO is achieved): This is assessed at the end of the tP.
     Specifically, marks are deducted (individually) if there are more than 1-2 violations in tP commits; 
     those who receive full marks for this component are considered as achieving the LO.<br>
     To verify the target LO Level is achieved (i.e., able to self evaluate/monitor), 
     no feedback about Git convention compliance is given during the tP,
     except for one early warning.
   * #g#**Strategy**## (i.e. steps are taken to help students achieve this LO, at the target level): 
     During the iP period, we do the following, to take you towards the target LO level:
     1. First, specify the Git standard and ask students to follow.<br>
        Also, remind about it via a tutorial question.
     1. After a while, indicate if the student is following if correctly via the dashboard
        (i.e., `GitStandard` is red/green)
     1. At some point, specify what rules are violated
        (done during code quality feedback posted in iP issue tracker;  will be done one more time after the iP is over)
     1. At the end of iP, insist on correct format for the last five commits -- a student cannot earn 
        full marks for the iP unless this requirement is met (affected students notified already).<br>
        Note: This step was introduced this semester, in the hope of increasing the success rate of achieving this LO,
        above the rate 96% that we achieved last semester.
* **Why not have traditional lectures/tutorials?**:
  Yes, we do realize _some_ students prefer our lectures to cover content (the way traditional lectures do). 
  But based on our past surveys, the majority prefers to consume the course content at their own pace.<br>
  Unlike most foundation CS courses (e.g., CS2109S, CS2100, CS2105, ...) in which almost all students start the course
  with similar level of knowledge of the topics, students in this course have very different levels of prior
  knowledge (and interest) on any SE topic we cover. So, it is hard to design such lectures that fit everyone.
  Hence, we now use blended mode delivery that allows you to regulate your own consumption of the contents.<br>
  Also, self-learning how to use tools such as Git, GitHub, Gradle, JUnit etc., 
  from given resources is good practice for future, as such tools are emerge and evolve rapidly.
