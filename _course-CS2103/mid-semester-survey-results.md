Good to see most of you found the course briefing videos useful. Previously, course admin info used to be
covered during weekly briefings, but this time we experimented with extracting them out as a separate
category of videos called 'course briefing' videos.

Glad to see most found weekly briefings to be useful.

A general note: Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, 
 our weekly briefings serve as a _complementary_ 'top up', covering additional examples,
 motivations behind the topics, commentary on how to shape your attitudes related to the subject,
 anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip weekly briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-briefing quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 **:fas-exclamation: Caveat: Totally ignoring weekly briefings will disqualify you from future CS2103/T 
 tutor positions**
 though, as we do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course.

The feedback for the course website is quite positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, we thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, if you are someone who normally prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part
 in tutorial discussions, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. 
 We hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure 
  (like many other things in this course)
  aims to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We had to move to F2F mode**, to comply with NUS
    policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), we expect physically
    meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
    We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
    both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
  * **Having two tutorials in the same venue is not ideal**, but we have no choice due to lack of enough
    small venues. So, it is a compromise we've made to keep tutor-to-student ratio low while making do with the
    current venues we have. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    Pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * **Less is more, hopefully**: So, while our tutorials only discuss a small number of relatively simpler questions,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ 
    has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class,
    although the learning gain for stronger students may be less than usual==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, we hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

The most common concern about this course is the workload. As per the responses tally above, it seems the
course load is 'too high' for some.
  On the positive side, ==we have lowered the bar for the tP implementation component by half==. 
  Hopefully, it'll make the workload of the second half lighter than in previous rounds.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis.
    Aim to do less but do it really well.<br>
    ==Plan to add/update tP features in small steps== (each step leading to a usable and slightly better version
    of the feature), so that you can stop any time the workload seems to be exceeding what you are prepared for.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.

That said, we know the workload concern is real, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice, which makes the workload feel heavy, especially if you don't have a lot of prior programming
    experience.

<markdown>Maybe it's the fact that Tasks are released on a weekly basis, it's difficult to get a sensing of the overall timeline, I.e., when we start coding for the tP, how many weeks do we have, how many iterations, etc. Especially since it was mentioned in the first week (I believe) that the future tasks may change so we should avoid working ahead.

<markdown>I feel like the topics for each week is honestly too much that alot of people give up reading it and just use it to answer questions for the quiz. I think that if you asked all the students if they read the topics before doing the quiz i think most of them will say they dont or only read some. I think the course would benefit from reducing the number of quiz questions and topic content so that instead of 

case 1: dont read 10 topics, opens it up just to do quiz 
case 2: read 5 topics before quiz and answers 25 challenging quiz questions instead of 50 easy true or false questions

the project and ip workload thus far I feel is very good and manageable and the forum is excellently implemented. 
If there is a feature to comment anonymously on the forum to get questions answered similar to piazza i think that would be great.

I really like the management of this course and can tell that prof damith especially is extremely passionate and is trying to optimize and improve this course with each semester.

My biggest feedback would be to reduce the topic content. or summarize it further and instead of 50 easy quiz questions have 20 medium difficulty ones

These are just my opinions and i think you could try creating a poll for the whole cohort to answer to see how to adjust the course

Thank you for your time</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Thanks for takaing time to write detailed comments. 

1. I agree that the number of topics and the number of questions seems quite high. One of the downsides of doing the project iteratively is that students need to know more things early - hence, our hand is forced in terms of what topics to cover. To prevent becoming overwhelmed by the amount of content, we want students to treat the reading of a topic as 'first (of many) contact'. So, the goal is to become 'aware' of related concepts, not to learn it fully and deeply rightaway. Accordingly, the questions are also straight forward, aiming to ensure student have come into contact with the said topics. The deeper understanding of the topic comes over time, as the concepts are revisited in the project, tutorial, the following weekly briefing (i.e., recap of previous week), etc. The high number of questions is also to ensure even if a student is skimming the topic only for the purpose of answering the quiz, that student still read enough of the topic to become aware of the concepts in concern. For examaple, first become aware that there is such as thing called 'PR'. Learning the details can be skipped over, to be revisited when you need to actually create a PR later.   

2. Good point about anonymous posting feature. Unfortunately, GitHub issue tracker doesn't suport such a feature, and we'd rather use an SE relevant tool such as GitHub issue tracker for the forum (rather than something like Piazza)

3. Circling back to reducing topic content, the good news is, while you might feel there is too much content in the early part of the semester, it might not be the same by the time you reach the exam. After iterating through the topics a few times over the semester, it doesn't feel like a lot. Another thing to note is that we stop covering new topics by week 11, to give you  enough time to apply the knowledge into the project. Given week 1 is all prereq topics, all topics of this course are covered in 10 weeks (instead of the usual 13), which is another reason why you feel like there is too much content per week.</markdown>

<markdown>I don't like that the weekly briefings are on Friday (at the end of the week). Considering that our tutorials happen before the briefing, there is a lot of pressure to do our work over the weekends, making teamwork less effective. (This point might only apply to CS2103, not the T variant but being that our only options were Fridays)

I am sorry I do not have any strong suggestions but I feel that the content and information dissemination is very complicated and overwhelming initially. Also, I find the use of so many different websites or platforms creates a lot of unnecessary confusion. (Canvas, external Github website Zoom, Teams). Hope maybe there's a way to improve in this area! Thank you

I feel that while this module has emphasized and aims to allow the student to independently learn, I do feel that there is a need for more support especially at the start of the module (particularly before the start of the IP) I feel that maybe sessions similarly to how the tutorial is conducted, for aims toward the IP project would be more useful.

Good points: 
I appreciate the module and its content so far, I find it very useful and the tutorial has been quite engaging. There are a lot of resources and relevant information provided.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, having the lecture slot on Friday 4pm is not ideal;  unfortunately our lecture slot cannot be changed (we tried) due to other constraints, and due to venue availability issues, some tutorials get scheduled in awkward timings. That said, Friday tutorials have the advantage that they have 6 days between the corresponding weekly briefing and the tutorial, giving them the longest time to learn the topics before attending the tutorial that tests that knowledge. 

Regarding information overload, hope you are more familiar with the way this course delivers information, and less overwhelmed compare to the initial weeks. 

Similarly, I hope you are on track with the self-learning by now, despite difficulties faced at the start. Our goal is  make all students strong self-learners, and one strategy we use for that is to let students try first, and help only if they still can't make if after trying a few times, instead of offering help at the very start. We did hold a iP help session two weeks into the semester, and only a handful of students turned up for it. Had we offered a help session at the very start, a lot more students could have turned up, which shows that most of them managed to learn the stuff on their own when there was no upfront help, which to me is a positive outcome.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>1. In a large course such as ours, taken by students with varying levels of prior experience, some things meant to train less-experienced stuents can appear as 'busy work' for those who already have that knowledge.

2. Also, we require some things to be done in a very specific ways (name a file in a specifc format and put it in a specific location) so that we can automate some admin work (e.g., send automated reminders when a pending deliverable is nearing the deadline). These extra requirments too can appear as creating 'busy work'. 



Hopefully, you can use the flexibility of the course to skip things you see as 'busy work' (or at least do only the minimum).</markdown>

I personally think the FXML and Scene Builder portion can be elaborated on, perhaps have a section for additional information/useful use cases similar to the implementation in the weekly topics tab.
Another addition that I think would be great is to have some possible answers to some of the exercises listed at the bottom of each part so I can cross reference with my answers.

Also, is it possible to add a note at the start of the JavaFX guide that all of the work in first 3 parts will be replaced in the 4th part. This is more so for future students.</markdown>

Regarding the issue of not having friends in the course, the best we can do is to form teams early so that you have 'work colleagues' that you can collaborate with. On the positive side, working with a team of colleagues (rather than friends) is closer to what one does when working as a software engineer.    </markdown>

<markdown>I sought to make use of AI to help me for CS2103T. I have been programming for awhile but never got around to setting up Copilot until this course, and I have found it extremely useful so far (to the point that I plan to use Copilot for all my other projects).

Specifically for the iP, I think Copilot is quite opinionated (probably from being trained on many versions of Duke online), and sometimes suggests code before I even have the time finish thinking about what I want to write. This became less of a problem as the weeks progressed, as I started to morph the iP into something more personal.

I would highly recommend all students should try to use Copilot at least once throughout the course (albeit maybe at the end so they can better appreciate the difficulties it helps solve).</markdown>

<markdown>The iP feels slow and fast paced at the same time, I would much rather prefer if we could read ahead, and do future increments of the project early, even though I understand that the main objective is to pace our work to simulate a work setting.

The reality is that having to do weekly increments instead of having the freedom to choose when we want to read ahead and do the project feels a little too unengaging when there is a lull period in terms of workload from other modules (week 1-2, 4), and a little too demanding during peak periods (week 3 (tutorials begin), week 5-7 (midterm season)).

It would be nice if we could offset future work by putting more work in currently and not be bogged down by the pacing of the course, but I understand if this is something that cannot be compromised on.

This might be a nitpick that few people have, due to my (unconventional) working style of trying to read ahead and clearing work early so I can focus on midterms. It will help with my performance for other modules as well.

As for other aspects of this module, the resources have been excellent, and the support from the teaching team has been nothing short of amazing as well. Kudos to the CS2103 team!</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Good point about lull periods of the semester. We don't want students to go too far ahead, but going about one week ahead of the schedule should still be fine. What we don't want is for someone to do the bulk of the project in one go because that approach doesn't allow the student to appreciate/learn the skills needed to evolve code over a longer period.

Thanks for the kind words about the course :-).</markdown>

<markdown>i dont understand why this course has to adopt a "friday is the start of the week" concept. why can't we just follow the normal week like other modules? as a result of this, students often have to work on weekends especially since the bonus for the quiz ends on monday. I think it just makes life difficult for students and is redundant frankly. for instance, lets say if i finished my work for other modules by friday, now its the "start of the week" and i have to start working again.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>It is good if a student (such as yourself) wants to, and has the capability to, do all the course work within Mon-Fri and keep the weekend free for other things. It is still possible. Such a student can totally ignore the "Friday is the start of the week" thing, start the  work on Monday, and finish everything by Friday. 

To make this option even more feasible, ==we'll be moving the quiz bonus points cut-off to Tuesday, starting from week 7== so that you have two doys to study the topics even if you start on Monday.

By providing the briefing and weekly requirements early (i.e., on Friday), and the teaching team being active/available during the weekend, we also allow students to start their work early and spread the work over 7 days instead of 5, if they find that is more preferrable. 

Our experience is that the latter is the most common pattern, but both pattern of working is still possible, and you can decide which one you want to follow.

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **iP workload is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
  Setting a slightly higher bar around that period can cause some students to fall behind a bit,
  which hopefully pushes them to work harder to catch up while there is still enough time to catch up
  i.e., it is better to fall behind early rather than later.
* **Working on weekends**: We realize that having to work on the weekend is not ideal.
  In our case it feels even worse because our lecture slot
  is on Friday and the tasks for the next week are released on Friday as a result. In theory, it is possible to
  not work on weekends nevertheless; but in practice, I can't imagine the typical SoC workload can be done
  without working through at least _some_ part of the weekend. It is one of the sacrifices one has to make to be in
  an in-demand field such as CS, especially if you don't have some programming experience already.<br>
  In fact, I can't even remember the last time I did not have to work through the weekend :-(
