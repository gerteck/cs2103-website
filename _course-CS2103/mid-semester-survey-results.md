Good to see most of you found the course briefing videos useful. Previously, course admin info used to be
covered during weekly briefings, but this time we experimented with extracting them out as a separate
category of videos called 'course briefing' videos.

Glad to see most found weekly briefings to be useful.

A general note: Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, 
 our weekly briefings serve as a _complementary_ 'top up', covering additional examples,
 motivations behind the topics, commentary on how to shape your attitudes related to the subject,
 anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip weekly briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-briefing quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 **:fas-exclamation: Caveat: Totally ignoring weekly briefings will disqualify you from future CS2103/T 
 tutor positions**
 though, as we do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course.

The feedback for the course website is quite positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, we thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, if you are someone who normally prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part
 in tutorial discussions, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. 
 We hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure 
  (like many other things in this course)
  aims to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We had to move to F2F mode**, to comply with NUS
    policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), we expect physically
    meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
    We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
    both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
  * **Having two tutorials in the same venue is not ideal**, but we have no choice due to lack of enough
    small venues. So, it is a compromise we've made to keep tutor-to-student ratio low while making do with the
    current venues we have. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    Pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * **Less is more, hopefully**: So, while our tutorials only discuss a small number of relatively simpler questions,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ 
    has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class,
    although the learning gain for stronger students may be less than usual==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, we hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this course is the workload. As per the responses tally above, it seems the
course load is 'too high' for some.
  On the positive side, ==we have lowered the bar for the tP implementation component by half==. 
  Hopefully, it'll make the workload of the second half lighter than in previous rounds.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis.
    Aim to do less but do it really well.<br>
    ==Plan to add/update tP features in small steps== (each step leading to a usable and slightly better version
    of the feature), so that you can stop any time the workload seems to be exceeding what you are prepared for.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.

That said, we know the workload concern is real, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice, which makes the workload feel heavy, especially if you don't have a lot of prior programming
    experience.

<markdown>Suggestion: Course should aim for either making the chatbot in CLI or GUI format because transitioning from CLI to GUI seems to be work overload.

Feedback: Really good module as it does not force you to do optional things, its just our wish to do it or not. The more we do the better knowledge we gain! Instructions are well laid for the new things we learn in this module.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad you liked the flexibility of the course.

It is true that evolving from CLI to GUI can appear a lot of work, which would be the case for most students. But the more important questions is, now that you've gone through it, if you were to do it again, would you design the CLI version differently so that adding a GUI is easier? The answer should be 'yes' -- the CLI version _can_ be written in a way that it is easy to swap out the CLI with GUI, or add the GUI while keeping the CLI as well. In software projects, it is always possible to have to implement features that were not aniticipated at the start, and the effort required to implement such features depends on the quality of the design. Not to worry if this doesn't sound convincing. We'll be covering more design-related topics in the coming weeks.

<markdown>The topic videos help in giving an overview of the content at a high level manner (or rather because I prefer video to reading text). The weekly briefing is interesting because it recaps the concepts with analogies and bring in additional insights. The analogies are helpful.

It is true that the workload for the course is rather high, but, I think it is part and parcel of learning. I don't see how it can be mitigated / have the workload decreased except requiring us to spend the time understanding the content and trying out the tools and code.

<markdown>I don't really have complaints about the course. I think the material, content, and structure is great. The workload might be a little much, but I guess it is also understandable given what this course is trying to achieve in terms of what to impart students with, which I really appreciate. I'm honestly really glad with the structure and admin side of this course (e.g some hard and some soft deadlines esp for IP) because it gives me the flexibility to catch up. I think it also forces us to manage our time and responsibility well, and gives us good opportunity to not only improve our own technical skills, but our soft-skills and teamwork as well.</markdown>

<markdown>I feel that the workload for the course was quite high in the early weeks (weeks 2-3). I spend quite a bit of time on doing the iP tasks that are due on Friday. The worst was spending Monday-Thursday doing just CS2103T content. I believe a large reason was because of the high amount of content per week (take me at least 1+ days to just read through the content in "Topics". That plus the iP tasks have proven to be quite heavy for me. Coming into weeks 4, I feel that the amount of iP tasks have lighten by a significant amount which I think is good since more time is freed up for my other modules.

However, this does not mean I find the module dreadful. I can't deny it feels very tiring to do all the required tasks every week but I am glad that I am learning something each week. The concept of just having to hit the minimal level to get the marks also help to reduce the workload (though there are times I want to do more but lack the time to do so).

The thing I liked the most so far is the support that the teaching team has provided. This comes in the form of responding to forum questions and checking up with the students through emails based on the pre-course survey. In any modules, having a supportive teaching team like this is something I value a lot, not only does it encourage me to approach others more but it also allow me to place more focus on learning rather than grades. This is something that I think has been done well and I hope this will continue in the future as well.</markdown>

<markdown>Overall, i think the set-up of the module in terms of content, pedagogy, assessment weightage, methods are all good. However, there is a lack of concrete, specific feedbacks. I understand that alot of things in SWE are not black and white and is up to public consensus as well as following rules like coding standard. I also understand the part about learning through practice. However, it is very hard to improve without knowing what we did well or even better what we did wrong. To better illustrate using an example, for example git-standard, all we get is a green/red tag. Despite maintaining a consistent format (personal opinion of course) the tag some times is green sometimes is red. Which means  am left to guess which I dont think this is a good way to teach? Even if somehow the reason is for asssessment integrity, we should figure out ourselves, this contradicts the pass-fail aspect of iP and it being a way to improve ourselves before tP. I am sure we all can agree it is better to learn from mistakes than correct answers. Providing a coding standrad, quality and whatsoever is learning from correct answer. I do not know what i did wrong when something goes wrong and is left to guess. I think it is not difficult to add in the part where is violates the checking script as a log to feedback to us so we know what is done wrong/can be improved. Maybe the current way to force us to be more attentive to details as real world does not have answers or feedback (though not true as code review will tell us specifically what to do better). I think this current format can be maintained for example the first 4 weeks then for week 5, 6 concrete feedback can be released whenever things like, using the same example, git-standard violation occurs so that we can learn in time to not make the same mistake for tP otherwise, How am i different at week 1 and week 13 beside a few more educated guesses</markdown>

I think the less important information could benefit from having just 1 component, rather than 3 separate components. Or maybe include why there are 3 separate modals for it.

I definitely think that some of W3's tasks should be placed with W4 as A-MoreOOP takes a large chunk of time to accomplish as I would imagine many would need to refractor a large amount of their code. In comparison, the workload for W4 is a lot lighter.

 

Other than that, I am extremely grateful that the teaching team is putting in so much effort into running the module. Thank you so much!</markdown>

<a id="general"/>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **iP workload is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
  Setting a slightly higher bar around that period can cause some students to fall behind a bit,
  which hopefully pushes them to work harder to catch up while there is still enough time to catch up
  i.e., it is better to fall behind early rather than later.
* **Can give more feedback on if what we are dong correct/wrong?**: ?
  evaluative judgement, dashboard, tests, compare, ask/discuss
