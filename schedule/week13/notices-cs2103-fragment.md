<panel type="info" header="##### Course Briefing Videos" expanded >

There is no weekly briefing this week. Instead, we have the following two course briefing videos. Viewing is highly recommended, as ==both can help you with your exam preparations==.

Please note that ==tutors will not be available for consultations _after_ this week== (doesn't apply to this week). As most tutors are UG students who have their own exams, we do not allow {{ course_pair }} students to take up tutors' time during the reading week and the exam period. This is especially important for {{ course_pair }} tutors as they have to spend a significant time on adjudicating disputed PE bugs.

Any questions related to the course should be posted in the [forum]({{ url_forum }}) (preferred) or sent to the course email `{{ course_email }}`.
