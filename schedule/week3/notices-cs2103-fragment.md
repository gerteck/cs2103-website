<panel type="info" header="##### ==[MUST-WATCH]== One More Course Briefing Segment (9 minutes)" expanded >

**One more course briefing segment to watch this week**: The bulk of the course briefing was released as pre-recorded videos last two weeks. There are few more remaining parts which will be released closer to events they cover %%(e.g., the part covering the exam will be released closer to the exam)%%. This week, we have one more course briefing segment, given below:

<include src="../../admin/courseBriefings.md#course-briefing-w3" />

**The _weekly_ briefing for this week will be done in hybrid mode** -- you can attend it F2F %%(@{{ lecture_venue }} {{ get_date(date_w2_start, 4, format=format_normal, time="from 4pm") }})%%, join via Zoom, watch the recording later, or skip it altogether).<br>
==**iP Help Session**==: This week's' briefing will be followed by a F2F help session for those who are stuck in the iP due to technical difficulties. To attend that help session, be in {{ lecture_venue }} at least by 4.50pm.
