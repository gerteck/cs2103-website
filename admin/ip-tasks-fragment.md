#####  **FAQ** about iP increments{.text-info}

<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** How are the iP git tags used in grading?">

**A.** Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you _think_ you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations.
</panel>
<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** What if I discovered a bug after I finished an increment?">

**A.** Go ahead and fix it in a subsequent commit. There is no need to update the previous commit or move the corresponding tag to the new commit. As we do not test your code at every tag, earlier bugs will not affect your grade as long as they are fixed eventually. Similarly, feel free to improve the code of previous increments later.
</panel>
<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** I did multiple increments in the same commit. How to fix?">

**A.** You can add the corresponding tags to the same commit.<br>
Optionally, if you haven't pushed the commit to the fork yet, you can try to figure out how to split that commit into multiple commits.
</panel>
<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** The requirements of an increment scheduled for this week is already satisfied by the work I did in an earlier week. What now?">

**A.** You can add the corresponding tag to the earlier commit (or the latest commit -- it doesn't matter) and push the tag.
</panel>
<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** My iP increments are not detected by the dashboard because I forgot to push my tags earlier. What now?">

**A.** Not to worry. Just push the tags now. They will be detected by the dashboard at the next update. There is no penalty if mistakes are detected and fixed soon after.
</panel>
<panel type="seamless" header="**Q.** Oh no! I made a mistake in my tag/branch name.">

##### iP feels like 'same same' ...?{.text-success}

**As you do the iP, if you feel like you are not learning enough new stuff** as you've done similar work before (at least on the Java/OOP side), there is an alternative approach you can take to the iP. See the panel below if you are interested.

<panel type="seamless" header="****iP.AI****: an AI-assisted approach to the iP" minimized>

**Goal**: In the iP.AI approach, your goal is to minimize hand-coding the iP, by getting generative AI tools (such as Co-Pilot) to write the code for you instead. The learning goal is to explore how to increase your coding productivity using AI tools.

**Requirements:**

1. You should follow the normal iP requirements/deadlines, except that you will try to replace handcoding with AI-assisted code generation, where possible. It is still fine to do some of the coding work manually.
1. You may use any free or commercial AI tools, provided you declare which tool you used (how to declare? see next point).
1. Add a file named `AI.md` at the root of project folder (same location where `CONTRIBUTING.md` lives). Commit the file. Keep it updated with a record of your use of AI tools (e.g., which tool you used for which increment), and interesting observations (e.g., what worked? what didn't? overall, how much time did it save?). You can update this file periodically (e.g., once a week). The content format can be plaintext or Markdown. It need not be very detailed (e.g., even a 0.5 page is enough).

**Caveat:** This alternative does not earn you extra credit, but it gives you an opportunity to learn more about AI tools related to SE, with the same (or even less) effort.<br>
This alternative is only suitable for those who are already good at hand-coding. Reason: At the current state of the art of AI tools, only those who are already good at hand-coding can use those tools to increase productivity. So, you must become good at hand-coding before you venture into using AI tools for coding.

* Do each increment as a Git branch. Here is an example:
  * Start a branch named `branch-{increment ID}` (e.g. `branch-Level-5`). You are recommended to have multiple commits in that branch. Follow the branch naming convention exactly or else our gradings scripts might miss your branch.
  * After the increment is ready, merge the `branch-Level-5` back on to `master`, ==without a _fast-forward_== so that git creates a separate commit for the merge. `git tag` that merge commit as `Level-5`.

  1. Now, go back to the `master` branch and merge the two branches one after the other.<br>

  1. Implement Level 7 while committing to that branch at appropriate points,
  1. Merge the branch back to the master branch (remember to create a merge commit i.e., ==no fast-forward==).
  1. Git tag the merge commit in the `master` branch as usual (i.e., add the tag `Level-7`).
  1. Push the `master` branch, push the `branch-Level-7`, and push the tag, to your fork.<br>

     {{ icon_important_big_red }} Only _merged_ branches are detected by the script. After merging a branch `b1` to the `master` branch, you need to push both the `master` and the `b1` branches to the fork. Pushing the `master` branch does not automatically take the `b1` branch along with it just because it is already merged to the `master` branch.

  Answer: Not to worry. You are welcome to (but not _required_ to) try to rectify it. There is no penalty. Just take note of your mistake and try to avoid it in the future.
</panel>
<p/>

* **Do Level 8 similar to the above**, using a branch `branch-Level-8`.

<div tags="m--cs2113" id="as-parallel-prs">

* **Note how to merge PRs**:

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/managePRs/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → **Merging PRs**", "1", indent=1) }}

* **Practice using parallel git branches _and_ PRs**, as explained below:
1. First, do each increment as a parallel branch (follow the branch naming convention you followed earlier `branch-Level-8` etc.), but do not merge any.
1. Then, push each branch to your fork, and create a PR !!within your fork!! (i.e., from the increment branch to the `master` branch). ==Be careful not to create a PR to [the upstream repo]({{ url_course_org }}/ip).== %%If you did create such a PR by mistake, no worries, just close it yourself.%%

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/createPRs/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → **Creating PRs**", "1", indent=1) }}

3. Now, merge one of the PRs and update the remaining PRs accordingly, as given below:
   1. Merge one of the PRs on GitHub. Remember to choose the `Create merge commit` option when merging.
1. The above step will cause the `master` branch of your local repo to fall behind that of your fork (<popover content="because your remote `master` branch (i.e., `origin/master`) now has a merge commit that the local `master`">why</popover>). Therefore, you need to sync the local `master` with the remote `master` branch. One way to do that is to switch to the local `master` branch and then pull the updated `master` branch from your fork e.g.,
      ```{.no-line-numbers}
      $ git checkout master
      $ git pull origin master
      ```
   * Note how the remaining <tooltip content="i.e., branches not merged to the `master` branch yet">un-merged branches</tooltip> are no longer in sync with the latest `master`. To rectify, merge the `master` branch to each of them. Resolve merge conflicts, if any.{ texts="['4.1)','4.2)','4.3)']" }
   * Push the updated branches to your fork. The PRs will update automatically to reflect the updated branch.
   * As before, tag the merge commit in the master branch and push the tag to your fork.
1. Merge the remaining PRs using a procedure similar to the above.

One of the iP increments asks you to push the design more towards the OOP approach. This is a good point to remind you the following points:

****Good OOP != OOP is good****: While the course pushes you to use _good OOP_, do not interpret it as a message of _OOP is good_; it's good for many situations but not so for some other situations. The best is usually a combination of approaches. Hence, you are encouraged to get better at other paradigms, the _functional_ paradigm in particular which has been rising in popularity in some areas such as big data, AI, parallel systems.<br>
That said, it is also preferable to use one paradigm as the primary approach and fallback on others only when the primary paradigm is clearly sub-optimal. Reason: mixing everything in equal measures might make the system even harder to understand.

**OOP is primary paradigm for this course and you are expected to try to push it to its limits.** That should give you a first-hand experience of OOP's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, OOP (or any other paradigm) will appear worse than it really is if not used correctly, and learning to use it correctly in increasingly larger systems is another objective you can aim for in this course. {% if cs2103 %}As you do the tP later, you'll also realize that while OOP is used for the internal design of its components, the higher-level design is not specifically an OOP one.{% endif %}<br>

**We do not prohibit the use of other paradigms**, however. For example, if you find a place where the _functional_ approach is better, go ahead and use it. As you know, Java supports functional programming to a certain extent. {% if cs2103 %}In fact, the tP code given to you uses small snippets of functional-style code in several places.{% endif %}

{{ embed_topic(baseUrl+"/admin/appendixD-help.md#main", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " Appendix D: Getting Help", "2") }}
</box>

1. **Fork** [{{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}]({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}), while noting the points below:<br>
   <box type="important" seamless><md>==**Keep the fork name as `{{ ip_repo_name }}`**== or else our grading scripts will not be able to detect it. You can change the fork name to something else after the semester (and the grading) is over e.g., after receiving your grade for the course.</md></box>
   <box type="tip" seamless><md>**Untick the `[ ] Copy the master branch only` option** so that you get a copy of the full repo.</md></box>
1. ==**Enable the issue tracker** of your fork== (Go to `Settings` of your fork, scroll to the `Features` section, and tick the `Issues` checkbox). %%Reason: at times we post feedback on your issue tracker.%%<br>
   <box type="tip" seamless><md> If the issue tracker is enabled, you should be able to visit the following URL `https://github.com/{your_user_name}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/issues`<br> e.g., `https://github.com/johnDoe/{{ ip_repo_name }}/issues`</md></box>
1. **Clone the fork** onto your computer.
1. **Set up the project in your IDE** as explained in [the README file]({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/blob/master/README.md), if you plan to use an IDE for the project.

<div id="desc_create_pr_to_upstream">

* Create a <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:ipTasks-createPr">pull request (PR)</trigger> from your fork to the upstream repo. Note the following:
  * Create the PR from the `master` branch of your fork to the `master` branch of the upstream repo ({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }})
  * Set the PR name as `[{Your full/partial name or your GitHub username}] iP`<br>
    e.g., `[Richard Mathews Chee] iP` or `[Rich ... hee] iP` or `[TheRichMat] iP`<br>
    %%Note that the PR name will be publicly visible.%%<br>
    You may leave the description as empty.
  * If you created the PR correctly, it should appear in the list of PRs [here]({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/pulls).
  * Steps for creating a PR is given in this textbook topic (==steps 5 onwards==):

<modal large header="Pull Request (PR)" id="modal:ipTasks-createPr">

_Pull Requests_ is a mechanism for offering code to a repository e.g., a bug fix or a new feature. PRs allow developers to review, discuss, and refine proposed code changes before incorporating (i.e., _merging_) the new code to the repository.

##### DukePro

> “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen ([source](https://dansilvestre.com/productivity-quotes))

DukePro frees your mind of having to remember things you need to do. It's,
* text-based
* easy to learn
* ~~FAST~~ _SUPER_ FAST to use

All you need to do is,
1. download it from [here]().
1. double-click it.
1. add your tasks.
1. let it manage your tasks for you :wink:

And it is **FREE**!

Features:
- [x] Managing tasks
- [ ] Managing deadlines (coming soon)
- [ ] Reminders (coming soon)

---

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the `main` method:
```java{.no-line-numbers}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(MainApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

</panel>
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

If you wish, **you _may_ write the PR description to be very similar to the example** given above -- as the goal here is to demonstrate your mastery of the GFMD syntax (not ad writing skills).

     * Else: you can use IntelliJ.{% endif %}
   * The JAR file should be ==cross-platform and should work in a computer that has Java 17== (but no other Java version). To avoid version compatibility issues, we strongly recommend the following approach:
      1. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the root of your project folder.
      1. Run the `java -version` command to confirm the terminal is using Java 17.
      1. Run the `./gradlew clean shadowJar` command to create the JAR file.
3. **Do the following [_smoke tests_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software))** to ensure the jar file works %%(reason: a similar flow will be used when grading your iP)%%.<br>
   1. Copy the jar file to an empty folder and test it from there. This should surface issues with hard-coded file paths.
   1. Pass the jar file to team members and ask them to do a test drive. Assuming some of your team members' OS differ from yours, this should verify if the app is cross-platform.<br>
      {{ icon_tip }} If you don't have ready access to a specific OS, post a link to your JAR in the forum and ask
     others to help with the smoke testing -- some of them will even appreciate the opportunity to help a classmate.<br>

4. **Create a new release on GitHub** (e.g., `v0.2`) and upload the JAR file.

* **Add a demo** video or an animated gif to your user guide to show how the app works.
