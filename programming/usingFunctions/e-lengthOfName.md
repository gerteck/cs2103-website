#### Exercise : Length of Name

Write a program to read a name from the keyboard and print the length of the name. Follow the example below:
```{highlight-lines="2['John Doe']" .no-line-numbers}
What is your name?
John Doe
The length of your name is 8
```
{{ icon_info }} The `John Doe` in the second line is what the user types in. It is not an output from the program.

Here's another sample run of the same program:
```{highlight-lines="2['Jean Thomas']" .no-line-numbers}
What is your name?
Jean Thomas
The length of your name is 11
```

{{ icon_tip }} In addition to functions `print` and `input`, you may need the `len` function %%e.g., `len('abc')` returns `3`%%.
